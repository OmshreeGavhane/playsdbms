Create an index on a field for performance improvement:
You can create an index on a field, for example, "HotelNo" in the "Booking" table, which is often used in joins and where clauses for faster retrieval of data.

sql
Copy code
CREATE INDEX idx_HotelNo ON Booking (HotelNo);
Create one view on the above database and query it:
For example, you can create a view that lists the rooms for each hotel:

sql
Copy code
CREATE VIEW HotelRooms AS
SELECT h.Name AS HotelName, r.RoomNo, r.Type, r.Price
FROM Hotel h
JOIN Room r ON h.HotelNo = r.HotelNo;
Now, you can query this view:
sql
Copy code
SELECT * FROMÂ HotelRooms;
